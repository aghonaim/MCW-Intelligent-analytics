# Intelligent analytics hands-on lab unguided

## Abstract and learning objectives

This package is designed to facilitate learning real-time analytics without IoT. Participants will enable intelligent conversation in a machine learning-enabled, real-time chat pipeline to allow hotel guests to chat with one another, and to communicate directly with the concierge. They will also apply analytics to visualize customer sentiment in real-time. After completion, students will be better able to implement a lambda architecture, and enable web-based real-time messaging thru Web Sockets, Event Hubs, and Services Bus. In addition, participants will better understand how to:

-   Leverage Cognitive Services (LUIS & Text Analytics API)

-   Process Events with Web Jobs

-   Index with Search

-   Archive with Cosmos DB

-   Visualize with Power BI Q&A

## Overview

Adventure Works Travel specializes in building software solutions for the hospitality industry. Their latest product is an enterprise mobile/social chat product called Concierge+ (aka ConciergePlus). The mobile web app enables guests to easily stay in touch with the concierge and other guests, enabling greater personalization and improving their experience during their stay. Sentiment analysis is performed on top of chat messages as they occur, enabling hotel operators to keep tabs on guest sentiments in real-time.

## Solution architecture

Below are diagrams of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![The preferred solution is shown to meet the customer requirements. From right to left there is an architecture diagram which shows the connections from a mobile device to a Web Application.

*Tasks to complete*:

1.  Use <http://www.luis.ai> to create a new App.

2.  Set the App Settings in the LUIS website to use your subscription key (KEY 1) from your LUIS Account setup in the Azure Portal and activate it.

3.  Add an intent named OrderIn with an example utterance of "order a pizza."

4.  Add an entity named RoomService with hierarchical children FoodItem and RoomItem.

5.  Review the label for the utterance "order a pizza" and set the intent to OrderIn and entity (pizza) to FoodItem.

6.  Add new utterances for "Bring me toothpaste", "Bring me blankets", "Order a soda", and "Order me a pizza."

7.  Train the model.

8.  Publish the model.

9.  Test the model with the query "order me a pizza" and verify you get the intent of OrderIn (with a score close to 1.0) and entity pizza with a type of "RoomService::FoodItem".

1. Copy the App ID and Subscription Key from your LUIS app into the App.config of the ChatMessageSentimentProcessor project, to the luisAppID and luisKey settings respectively.

11. Complete TODO 13 in SentimentEventProcessor.cs.

12. Update the \_luisBaseUrl in SentimentEventProcessor.cs to match that base URL from your LUIS app.

*Exit criteria*:

-   All TODO items in SentimentEventProcessor.cs should be completed.

### Task 3: Implement speech to text

There is one last intelligence service to activate in the application---speech recognition. This is powered by the Bing Speech API, and is invoked directly from the web page without going through the web server. In the section that follows, you insert your Cognitive Services Speech API key into the configuration to enable speech to text.

*Tasks to complete*:

1.  Add your Speech API Key under the TODO in scripts\\chatClient.js of the ChatWebApp project.

*Exit criteria*:

-   You should have all TODO items complete in chatClient.js.

**Note**: Embedding the API Key as shown here is done only for convenience. In a production app, you will want to maintain your API Key server-side.

### Task 4: Re-deploy and test

Now that you have added sentiment analysis, language understanding, and speech recognition to the solution, you need to re-deploy the apps so you can test out the new functionality.

*Tasks to complete*:

1.  Publish the ChatMessageSentimentProcessor.

2.  Publish ChatWebApp.

*Exit criteria*:

-   Open a browser and navigate to your deployed website using HTTPS. Use multiple browser instances or tabs to simulate multiple users.

-   Send chat messages between them and verify that you see the sentiment indicator (a thumbs up or thumbs down icon next to each chat message).

-   You can order something from room service, like "bring me towels" and you get a response from the ConciergeBot.

-   You can select the microphone to the left of the text box and speak for two to three seconds. Your spoken message should appear.

    ![The Live Chat window has a chat going on between the Concierge Bot and the guest.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Intelligentanalyticsimages/media/image11.png "Live Chat window")

## Exercise 6: Building the Power BI dashboard

Duration: 30 minutes

Now that you have the solution deployed and exchanging messages, you can build a Power BI dashboard that monitors the sentiments of the messages being exchanged in real time. The following steps walk through the creation of the dashboard.

### Task 1: Create the static dashboard

*Tasks to complete*:

1.  Using PowerBI.com, create a new report from your streamed dataset that contains a semi-circular gauge. It should chart the average score, with a range of 0.0 to 1.0.

*Exit criteria*:

-   Your report should look like the following:
    
    ![A half-donut graph displays an Average score of 0.62.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Intelligentanalyticsimages/media/image12.png "Average of score donut graph")

### Task 2: Create the real-time dashboard

This gauge is currently a static visualization. You will use the report just created to seed a dashboard whose visualizations update as new messages arrive.

*Tasks to complete*:

1.  Create a new dashboard by pinning the gauge you created previously.

2.  Open the new dashboard.

3.  Enter the QA query "average score created between yesterday and today" and visualize it with the Gauge chart.

4.  Format the chart so it ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 and has an indicator at 0.5.

5.  Pin this visual to the dashboard you created.

6.  Delete the old static chart from the dashboard.

7.  Navigate to the ConciergePlus website and send some messages, observing that your Gauge updates in real time.

8.  Add three additional visualizations so your dashboard looks as follows:
    
    ![The Power BI dashboard has four panes: two Count of Messages panes, an Average Sentiment, and Upset Users. The first Count of Messages pane displays a number (18). The second Count of Messages is a pie chart broken out by username. The Average Sentiment is a donut chart displaying the Average Sentiment (0.58) in the past 24 hours. Upset Users chart is a horizontal bar chart displaying the average of upset users (0.25) in the past 24 hours.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Intelligentanalyticsimages/media/image13.png "Power BI dashboard")

*Exit criteria*:

-   Your chart should update in real-time and appear as above.

## Exercise 7: Enabling search indexing

Duration: 30 minutes

Now that you have primed the system with some messages, you will create a Search Index and an Indexer in Azure Search upon the messages that are collected in Azure Cosmos DB.

### Task 1: Verifying message archival

Before going further, a good thing to check is whether messages are being written to Azure Cosmos DB from the Stream Analytics Job.

*Tasks to complete*:

1.  Using the Azure Portal, navigate to Data Explorer for your Cosmos DB Collection.

*Exit criteria*:

-   You should see a list of document IDs, similar to the following:
    
    ![Documents has been selected from within the Data Explorer in the Azure Portal.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Intelligentanalyticsimages/media/image14.png "Data Explorer")

    ![Message contents display.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Intelligentanalyticsimages/media/image15.png "Message contents")

### Task 2: Creating the index and indexer

*Tasks to complete*:

1.  In your Azure Search Index, use the Connect to your data feature to index the collection.

2.  Provide any name for the index, but leave the Key set to id.

3.  Ensure that the id, message, createDate, and username are Retrievable.

4.  Ensure that createDate, username, and sessionId are Filterable.

5.  Ensure that create date, username, and sessionId are Sortable.

6.  Ensure that the message field is Searchable.

7.  Create an Indexer with a 5-minute interval that starts today.
